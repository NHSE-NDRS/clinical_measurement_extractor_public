You have this pathology report:
{document}

Your task is to tell me whether this report is talking about more than one tumour and to respond with a json with one key to indicate the presence of multiple tumours.

Multiple tumours can be identified in the following ways:
If the report explicitly states things like 'Tumour 1' or 'Tumour 2' then this indicates multiple tumours
If the report describes both the left and right breast and has clinical details and metrics for each then this indicates multiple tumours
If the report discusses tumours where each one has a different morphology then this indicates multiple tumours. Examples of morphologies include:
- Ductal
- Lobular
- No special type (NST)
- Tubular


Multiple specimens, biopsy samples and foci are not by themselves indicators of multiple tumours
In any other scenario treat the report as one tumour.

If a report contains multiple tumours then respond with "1", otherwise respond with "0".

Respond with a json in markdown format in the following way:
```json
{{"multi_tumour": "<value>"}}
```
Restrict your response to just the json structure above
